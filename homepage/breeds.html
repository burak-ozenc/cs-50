                </div>
            </div>

            <h5>Temperament</h5>
            <p>Despite their somewhat wild appearance, American Bobtails are devoted companion cats who fit
                perfectly
                into families. Social and easygoing, they get along well with children and other four-legged
                pets.</p>
            <p>Confident and friendly, Bobtails are highly intelligent pets with dog-like personalities. They love
                games like fetch and hide-and-seek, and even enjoy walking on a leash with their people.</p>


            <h5>Characteristics</h5>
            <p>The American Bobtail bears a distinct resemblance to a bobtailed wildcat. From her markings and
                alert,
                hunter’s gaze to her short, expressive tail, her appearance suggests a scaled-down version of that
                wild
                cat.</p>

            <h5>Lifespan</h5>
            <p>13 to 15 years</p>


            <h5>Colors</h5>
            <p>The American Bobtail’s coat can come in any pattern, including black, brown, chocolate, cinnamon,
                blue,
                lilac, fawn, red and cream, with or without white.</p>

            <h5>Shedding</h5>
            <p>The American Bobtail is a moderate shedding breed. Whether medium or long, her coat requires brushing
                only a couple of times a week to remove loose hair.</p>

            <h5>Health</h5>
            <p>American Bobtails are a very strong and healthy breed, with little known about genetic predisposition
                to
                health problems. However, they may develop hip dysplasia, and tailless American Bobtails can have
                spinal
                problems that affect their ability to control defecation.</p>

            <h5>Best Cat Food for American Bobtail Cats & Kittens</h5>
            <p>American Bobtails will generally thrive on the nutrition of a quality adult cat food. For Bobtails
                who
                need help with weight management, consider a healthy weight formula.</p>

            <p>American Bobtail kittens should eat a kitten food for their first year of life to aid in their growth
                and development.</p>


            <h5>History</h5>
            <p>Initially, the American Bobtail developed through natural selection. The breed’s foundation lies in
                feral domestic cats that had natural bobtails.</p>

            <p>Purposeful development of the breed began in the late 1960s, when John and Brenda Sanders were
                vacationing in the American southwest. They brought home a brown tabby kitten with a short tail,
                whom
                they found during their travels.</p>

            <p>The kitten later mated with the couple’s non-pedigreed domestic color point cat. Their kittens
                inherited
                the distinctive short tail, and attracted the attention of cat fanciers, who saw the possibility of
                a
                new breed of cats.</p>

            <p>Through selective breeding, the American Bobtail breed was officially established.</p>

            <h5>Facts</h5>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">The American Bobtail has a naturally short bobtail that can be seen
                    clearly above the back when she is
                    alert. No tail is exactly the same, but the average length is 1 to 4 inches.

            <p>With unique ears that curl back, and an inquisitive expression reminiscent of happy surprise, the
                American Curl brings a smile to everyone who meets her.</p>

            <h5>Temperament</h5>
            <p>A friendly, people-oriented breed, American Curls are known as the Peter Pan of cats because they
                retain their kitten-like personality throughout life. With her outstanding temperament, the Curl
                makes an affectionate soulmate and easily adjusts to other pets and children.</p>


            <h5>Characteristics</h5>
            <p>The American Curl has distinctive curled ears that form a graceful arc, giving her an alert, perky
                expression. In addition to their ears, Curls are known for their silky, flat coat which can be long
                or short.</p>

            <h5>Lifespan</h5>
            <p>13+ years</p>


            <h5>Colors</h5>
            <p>The American Curl’s coat can be brown, white, black, blue, red, cream, chocolate, lilac, silver or
                golden, with various patterns and shadings.</p>

            <h5>Shedding</h5>
            <p>The American Curl has two coat varieties: shorthair and longhair. Both coats are low-shedding.</p>
            <p>Like other shorthaired breeds, shorthair Curls need only weekly brushing, while longhair Curls should
                be brushed twice a week to help reduce matting and tangles.</p>

            <h5>Health</h5>
            <p>Due to a large gene pool, the American Curl is a generally healthy breed with no common genetic
                health issues. However, her ears should be checked and cleaned often to prevent infection.</p>

            <h5>Best Cat Food for American Bobtail Cats & Kittens</h5>
            <p>American Curls will generally thrive on the nutrition of a quality adult cat food. For Curls who need
                help with weight management, consider a healthy weight formula. </p>

            <p>American Curl kittens should eat a kitten food for their first year of life to aid in their growth
                and development. </p>


            <h5>History</h5>
            <p>The American Curl is a pedigree breed with humble beginnings—specifically a stray, longhaired black
                female cat with curled ears who showed up (and decided to stay) at the Lakewood, California home of
                Joe and Grace Ruga in 1981.</p>

            <p>Shulamith, as she was named, is the original American Curl to which all pedigreed Curls can be
                traced. When she gave birth to curl-eared kittens about six months later, the debate about the
                genetic origins of the “novelty” ears began, followed by a selective breeding program to develop a
                show breed.</p>

            <p>Renowned feline geneticist Roy Robinson analyzed data from 81 litters (383 kittens), and found that
                the ear-curling gene is autosomal dominant, so a cat with even one copy of the gene will show the
                trait.</p>


            <h5>Facts</h5>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    American Curl kittens are born with straight ears that begin to curl backward after three to
                    five days.

                    <h2>Ragdoll Cat Breed</h2>
                    <h4>Size</h4>
                    <p>Medium weighing 10 to 15 pounds</p>
                    <h4>Coat</h4>
                    <p>Semi-long, plush, silky</p>
                    <h4>Color</h4>
                    <p>Seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red and cream, plus various patterns and shadings, including
                        bi-color, van, colorpoint and mitted</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Ragdolls are loving, smart and playful. They show affection to their people by greeting them,
                following them around, sitting in their laps and snuggling in bed. Ragdoll cats can also learn
                tricks and certain behaviors with positive reinforcement.</p>

            <h5>Temperament</h5>
            <p>They may come when called and can even learn to play fetch. This sweet but playful feline prefers to
                remain on the same level as her people, rather than perched atop a bookcase or shelf. She’s good
                with children, other cats and dogs.</p>

            <h5>Characteristics</h5>
            <p>Ragdolls are one of the largest domestic cat breeds. They have a large head in a softer wedge shape
                than the sharp angular face of the Siamese.</p>
            <p>With a long, soft coat, oval-shaped blue eyes and medium-sized ears with rounded tips, their
                appearance matches their docile personality. They have a solid neck with a large and long, yet solid
                body, supported by a sturdy bone structure.</p>

            <h5>Lifespan</h5>
            <p>12 to 17</p>


            <h5>Colors</h5>
            <p>With point coloring similar to the Himalayan or Siamese breed, Ragdolls have light-colored bodies
                with darker extremities. With a color palette ranging from seal to blue to chocolate to cinnamon and
                more, the combinations of colors and patterns are almost endless. Ragdolls also have distinct blue
                eyes.</p>

            <h5>Shedding</h5>
            <p>Because Ragdoll Cats have little undercoat, they shed moderately throughout the year and more heavily
                in spring and fall. This also means less matting, but regular brushing is still necessary to keep
                the coat smooth, soft and free of tangles, mats and dead hair. If you’re gentle, your Ragdoll will
                adore the attention during grooming.</p>

            <h5>Health</h5>
            <p>Although DNA tests exist to help breeders weed out certain health problems, some complications may
                still arise for a Ragdoll. She may develop bladder stones or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of
                heart disease. Ragdolls also have a predisposition for feline infectious peritonitis.</p>

            <h5>Choosing the Best Food for Ragdoll Cats</h5>
            <p>Because of their large size, Ragdoll owners must provide their cats with a complete and balanced diet
                and plenty of playful exercise to maintain a healthy weight. Dry cat food options like Purina Cat
                Chow Indoor, Purina ONE Healthy Metabolism, Purina ONE Indoor Advantage or Pro Plan Weight
                Management Chicken & Rice Formula can aid in weight management to keep your Ragdoll kitty happy and
                healthy. Supplementing with wet cat food like Pro Plan Weight Management Turkey & Rice Entrée Ground
                or Pro Plan Indoor Care Salmon & Rice Entrée in Sauce can help provide hydration for her most active
                days. </p>

            <h5>Choosing the Best Food for Ragdoll Kittens</h5>
            <p>A kitten food that meets her unique nutritional needs during development will help her grow healthy
                and strong. Consider Pro Plan Kitten Dry & Wet Formulas for your growing Ragdoll kitten. Your
                veterinarian can advise you when to make the transition to adult food.</p>

            <h5>History</h5>
            <p>Ann Baker, a breeder in California, developed the breed in the early 1960s using free-roaming cats
                she found in her neighborhood. As time went on, she grew eccentric and other breeders broke
                distanced themselves to maintain the integrity of the breed.</p>

            <p>In 1993, the breed was registered with the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA), receiving full recognition
                in 2000. The American Cat Fanciers Association (ACFA) and The International Cat Association (TICA)
                also recognized the breed.</p>
